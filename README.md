# Linear-regression-for-weight-prediction
Project of creating a Linear Regression model from scratch using gradient descent
## Objective :
This project is mainly to enhance and improve my knowledge on the domain of Machine Learning not only by using Inbuilt models, but to learn the mathematical working of Models.This project would help me to step in to learn more advanced topics on Machine Learning.

## Description:
Building Univariate Linear Regression model with gradient descent formula without using inbuilt functions (from scratch!).The dataset has 2500 rows of data. X label is height column and y label is weight column(target column). 

## Outcome:
My model has working effeciently by giving 90% accuracy on data sets
